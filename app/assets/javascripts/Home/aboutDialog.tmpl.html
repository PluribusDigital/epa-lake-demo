        <p>The EPA <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/national-lakes-assessment">National Lakes Assessment</a> is a statistical survey of the condition of our nation's lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.
          This application allows you to explore that data. You can explore the dataset, viewing the data for a given lake. Further, you can gain context about the data. By clicking on a field, you get a definition of what it contains, as well as some descriptive statistics as to how the lake compares to other lakes.</p>
        <p>This prototype application was developed by 
          <a href="http://stsiinc.com/" target="_blank">STSI</a> as part of a response to a Request for Information published by the EPA.
          The EPA has done a great job of making raw data available as a set of CSV files. This prototype expands on that, allowing would-be users of the data a chance to "kick the tires" and understand the contents of the dataset.</p>
        <p>The source code for this application is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/STSILABS/epa-lake-demo">Github</a>.</p>
