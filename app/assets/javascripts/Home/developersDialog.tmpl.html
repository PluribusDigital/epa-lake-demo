        <p>This prototype is built on a GraphQL API, first developed by Facebook. GraphQL is an alternative to the REST pattern, most appropriate for APIs that don't fit the concept of traditional "resources". The notable example is social network data, with many nodes and relationships. We were interested in trying out GraphQL to gain experience with other potential benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Client-specified data format:</strong> The consumer of the API asks for only the data it needs, in the structure it desires. This seemed relevant with the NLA data, where there are approximately 1000 columns of data for a given lake.</li>
          <li><strong>Backward compatible:</strong> API versioning is painful for consuming or providing developers. With GraphQL, Fields can be added or deprecated incrementally.</li>
          <li><strong>Discoverable meta-data:</strong> The GraphQL endpoint includes meta-data about each field or relationship. This has many benefits, including the ability to create a quasi-IDE for query writing via GraphiQL.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can <a href="/graphiql/index.html" target="_blank">develop and test queries for this site via GraphiQL</a>. Try it out!</p>
